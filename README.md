# Magento 2 Countdown Timer GraphQL/PWA

**Magento 2 Countdown Timer GraphQL is now a part of the Mageplaza Countdown Timer extension that adds GraphQL features. This supports PWA Studio.** 

Creating urgency in a promotion campaign is a useful technique to trigger customers’ interest and urge them to grab the chance of discounts before it’s gone. [Mageplaza Countdown Timer for Magento 2](https://www.mageplaza.com/magento-2-countdown-timer/) is a useful tool to help you leverage this technique to increase the heat of your promotions or any marketing campaign. 

The extension will enable you to display visually-attractive countdown timer clocks that make your sales campaign more exciting and appealing to customers. There are two types of countdown timers with two different functions used usually in each campaign: Before Start countdown clock and Time Remaining clock. These two clocks are essential to draw customers’ attention to your campaign before it launches and alert them about the expiration time and hurry to get the benefits. 

It’s up to you to display the countdown clock based on your store’s real situations. Depending on your purposes, you can display the countdown timer clock beside the products with special prices, products with specific catalog rules, or coming-soon products. The conditions can be set at the backend and automatically apply to the products that meet the conditions. 

The extension provides you with 5 pre-made customizable templates which you can customize to create your own countdown clocks. You can change the color, shape and other related elements to match your store themes and styles. If you feel that the clocks look too boring, just modify them to meet your requirements in both visual and functional aspects. 

Now when you successfully create a ready-to-use countdown timer, it’s time to launch your countdown timer to add more effectiveness to your sales campaigns. But you don’t have to wait until the right time and manually activate the countdown timer. Magepaza Countdown Timer enables you to schedule the countdown clocks so that it’s automatically implemented along with your sales campaigns. You can effortlessly set the start date and end date of the countdown timer to enable it to run in a specific time only, which depends on your sales campaigns. 

Mageplaza Countdown Timer will not distract your customers when they are browsing your store but draw customers’ attention to what you want them to notice. To talk about the effectiveness of this technique, it depends. However, with a smart countdown timer generating tool,  it’ll be easier to create a countdown timer that’s friendly and attractive to the audience.
